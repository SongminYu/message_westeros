# message_westeros
This repo contains the "Westeros" tutorial of message_ix framework implemented in PyCharm.

## Todos

* go through the documentation again and reflect about the tutorial examples
* revise: `year_vtg` and `year_act` may also use `model_years` (see the "multi-node" example) --> understand the index names `year_vtg` and `year_act` better

## Questions

* issue created in message-ix repo --> `add_category` or `add_set`, `cumulative` in baseline model automatically
* one tutorial model is infeasible in my implementation.
* `year_col` has options of year, year_act, year_vtg --> why does it matter?
* time-series parameters are constant in the tutorial examples, can it vary?

## Note

* In MESSAGE, there is no explicit `commodity quantity` but only `technology activity`. You can use `level` or `mode` for distinction.
