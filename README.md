# message_westeros
This repo contains the "Westeros" tutorial of message_ix framework implemented in PyCharm.


## Questions

* issue created in message-ix repo --> `add_category` or `add_set`, `cumulative` in baseline model automatically
* one tutorial model is infeasible in my implementation.
* `year_col` has options of year, year_act, year_vtg --> why does it matter?
* time-series parameters are constant in the tutorial examples, can it vary?
